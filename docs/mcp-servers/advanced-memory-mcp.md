# Advanced Memory MCP & Webapp

**Research-Driven Knowledge Platform** - A dual-purpose system serving as both a powerful Model Context Protocol (MCP) server and a standalone React-based web application. Transform AI assistants into comprehensive research tools with multi-source intelligence gathering, semantic search (RAG), and intelligent skill synthesis.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Dual Architecture**: MemOps is a hybrid system consisting of a high-concurrency **FastMCP Server** (for tool integration) and a premium **React Webapp** (for visual knowledge management).

Advanced Memory evolves from a simple memory tool into an enterprise-grade research platform, integrating a robust vector database for semantic understanding.

## Core Capabilities

- **Multi-Source Research**: Web search, academic papers (arXiv), code repositories (GitHub), narrative patterns (TV Tropes)
- **Semantic Intelligence**:
    - **RAG Engine**: LanceDB + FastEmbed vector search with hybrid Whoosh/FTS5 integration.
    - **Optimized Reranking**: BGE-Reranker-v2-m3 with Flash Attention 2 support (RTX 4090).
    - **Encryption**: Transparent Fernet/AESnd (AES-128) metadata encryption for sensitive knowledge.
- **Portmanteau Tools**:
    - **adn_knowledge_rag**: High-density context retrieval bridge for OpenFang.
- **Document Intelligence**: PDF/EPUB processing with intelligent chunking and automated vector ingestion.
- **Agentic Workflows**: FastMCP 3.1+ SEP-1577 sampling with real tool functions — LLM autonomously orchestrates multi-step knowledge workflows via `ctx.sample(tools=[...], result_type=Model)`
- **Skill Synthesis**: Research-driven expert skill generation using FastMCP sampling
- **Knowledge Management**: Zettelkasten-based note system with Claude Skills export/import
- **Ecosystem Observability**: Real-time fleet discovery (Apps Hub) and agent session monitoring (Control Room)
- **Hardware Telemetry**: Native substrate tracking (GPU/CPU/RAM) with RTX 4094 optimization
- **Conversational AI** *(Planned)*: Natural language interaction with ADN tools and knowledge graph *(FREE - uses local Ollama)* → [Extension Plan](./CONVERSATIONAL_AI_README.md)
- **Production Observability**: State-of-the-art monitoring with Grafana dashboards, Prometheus metrics, Loki logs
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Compatible with Claude Desktop, Cursor IDE, Windsurf, and other MCP clients
- **Web Interface**: Standalone React application for direct usage without MCP client requirements. See [Webapp README](webapp/README.md) for startup, ports, and troubleshooting.

```

## Quick Start

## 🚀 Installation

### Prerequisites
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) installed (RECOMMENDED)
- Python 3.12+

### 📦 Quick Start
Run immediately via `uvx`:
```bash
uvx advanced-memory
```

### 🎯 Claude Desktop / Cursor Integration
Start the MCP server in stdio mode (required for Claude Desktop, Cursor, and other MCP clients). Add to your MCP config (e.g. Claude `claude_desktop_config.json`, or Cursor MCP settings):
```json
"mcpServers": {
  "advanced-memory": {
    "command": "uv",
    "args": ["--directory", "D:/Dev/repos/advanced-memory-mcp", "run", "advanced-memory", "mcp", "--transport", "stdio"]
  }
}
```
**Important:** The `mcp` subcommand and `--transport stdio` are required. Without them the process runs the CLI and exits; the server only starts with `advanced-memory mcp --transport stdio`. See `docs/CURSOR_MCP_SETUP.md` for Cursor-specific steps.
## 📦 Packaging & Distribution

This repository is SOTA 2026 compliant and uses the officially validated `@anthropic-ai/mcpb` workflow for distribution.

### Pack Extension
To generate a `.mcpb` distribution bundle with complete source code and automated build exclusions:
```bash
# SOTA 2026 standard pack command
mcpb pack . dist/advanced-memory-mcp.mcpb
```
```

### Standalone Web Application

**Canonical webapp docs:** [webapp/README.md](webapp/README.md) — ports (10704/10705), `start.ps1`, backend health check, and troubleshooting.

Alternative startup scripts (repo root):
```powershell
# RECOMMENDED: Clean startup (kills zombies, prevents port conflicts)
.\run-webapp-clean.bat  # Opens http://localhost:17770

# Alternative: Standard startup
.\run-webapp.bat  # Opens http://localhost:17770

# Check port usage and zombie processes
.\check-webapp-port.ps1  # Diagnose port conflicts

# Graceful remote shutdown
.\shutdown-adn.ps1 "Maintenance shutdown"  # Graceful shutdown via API
.\shutdown-adn.bat "System update"         # Batch version
```

**Important:** Webapp runs on **port 17770** (strict port, no hopping allowed). Always use `run-webapp-clean.bat` to kill zombie processes before restart. Use graceful exit endpoint for remote shutdown.

**Restart all:** Run `.\kill-adn-zombies.bat`, then `.\run-webapp-clean.bat`. Alternatively, start `node auto-start-service.js`, wait a few seconds, then `POST http://localhost:8003/start-all` to bring up startup, bridge, and webapp.

The webapp automatically detects and starts the ADN MCP server when you access the Notes page.

### Skill System

Advanced Memory MCP includes a comprehensive Claude Skills ecosystem with multi-IDE support.

#### Skill Locations

**CRITICAL: Skill directories are located in user home directories, NOT in this repository:**

- **Cursor Skills**: `C:\Users\[username]\.cursor\skills-cursor`
- **Windsurf Skills**: `C:\Users\[username]\.codeium\windsurf\skills`
- **ADN Skills**: `D:\Dev\repos\advanced-memory-mcp\skills` (this repository)
- **Antigravity Skills**: `C:\Users\[username]\.gemini\antigravity\skills`

#### Skill Documentation

- **[Skill Making Guide](docs/SKILL_MAKING_GUIDE.md)**: Complete workflow for creating and distributing skills
- **[Skill Discovery Guide](docs/SKILL_DISCOVERY_GUIDE.md)**: Finding and accessing skills across IDEs
- **[Skill Standards](docs/SKILL_STANDARDS.md)**: Quality and compatibility requirements
- **[Skill Uptake 2026](docs/SKILL_UPTAKE_2026.md)**: Current adoption trends and statistics
- **[Skill Parsing Architecture](docs/SKILL_PARSING_ARCHITECTURE.md)**: Technical implementation details

The webapp scans these directories recursively for `SKILL.md` files (including nested layouts such as `skills/category/skill-name/SKILL.md`) and displays them in the Skills page. Use **All collections** to show Cursor, WindSurf, Antigravity, and ADN skills together; you can also filter by folder.

### Manual Web Application Setup
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install
cd webapp && npm install

# Start services
node auto-start-service.js    # Service orchestrator
node startup-service.js       # Bridge server manager
cd webapp && npm run dev      # Web UI on http://localhost:17770
```

### Docker (webapp)
```powershell
# Build and run the webapp container (port 17770)
docker compose build webapp
docker compose up -d webapp
# Open http://localhost:17770
```
The webapp container serves the React UI only. Run the bridge and MCP server on the host (e.g. `.\run-webapp-clean.bat`) for full API access, or use the MCP Docker service (SSE on 8000) and configure `VITE_API_URL` if your setup differs.
